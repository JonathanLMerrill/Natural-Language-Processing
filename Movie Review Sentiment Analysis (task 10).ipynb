The supporting cast are also game and putting their best foot forward. It’s slow at times and sometimes it teeters close to romance than the other (more interesting) genres that it plays around with. BUT overall, I was hooked lined and sinker with this film.\"\n",

It is also allows the audience to take life seriously and to feel the sorrow of loss and abuse. The natural cinematography is excellent throughout. I thoroughly enjoyed watching and experiencing this drama. You also get to hear Taylor Swift sing at the end. : )\"\n",
